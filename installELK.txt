Install Java 8
Elasticsearch and Logstash require Java, so we will install that now. We will install a recent version of Oracle Java 8 because that is what Elasticsearch recommends. It should, however, work fine with OpenJDK, if you decide to go that route.

Add the Oracle Java PPA to apt:

sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:webupd8team/java
Update your apt package database:

sudo apt-get update
